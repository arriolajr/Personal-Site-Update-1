  <p> Originally, I was a NYCares volunteer, then over time, became a paid pantry floor supervisor.  NYCP feeds about 200 people day, and stands out by providing a robust menu, consisting mostly of fresh and local produce, and over much needed services.  It wasn't always a easy job, but it fufilling.  </p>

  <p> For over 10 years, I've done a good amount of projects. The project I did regularly was training with Achilles' Kids, readying them for races.  Eventually, I became a Team Leader, with my proudest moment was co-creating a summer curriculum to teach kids how to computer code.  </p>

  <p> Spent countless Saturdays here.  To be honest, I ran the dishwashing and kitchen clean up for several years.  My reign was harsh, but fair.  Seriously, this place has no missed a Saturday meal service for over 30, so this place already had a high standard, I was just trying to keep up.</p>
